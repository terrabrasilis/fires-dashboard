Attention: The input data was changed on September 1, 2024, regarding the aggregation periods and also the CAR property database. The main difference is that in the previous databases, an external buffer of 500 m was considered around PRODES deforestation and CAR properties; this buffer is no longer used in this new version.
<br/><br/>
Therefore, it was necessary to reprocess the entire database of active fires from August 1, 2019 to August 31, 2024. As a result, the current data may present variations in relation to the data available before this reprocessing. </p>

<p>
The objective of this panel is to analyze the active fires in vegetation detected
by satellite by the Queimadas project in two aspects:
<br/>
<b>1)</b> Active fires x Deforestation;
<br/>
<b>2)</b> Active fires x CAR; <br>
<small>The information will be updated monthly.</small>
</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>
<b>1)</b> Regarding deforestation, data generated by the PRODES, DETER and TerraClass projects are used to associate active fires with areas of recent deforestation, consolidated deforestation or areas of primary vegetation and secondary vegetation, as described below:
</p>

<p>
<b>1.1)</b> <span>Fire data</span><sup>1</sup>: geographic coordinates of active fires in vegetation extracted from the reference satellite - AQUA/MODIS afternoon passage - obtained monthly from the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/">Queimadas-INPE Portal</a>; </p><p>
<b>1.2)</b> <span>Consolidated deforestation</span>: includes the aggregation of the entire PRODES deforestation database up to 3 years prior to the date of the outbreak. Ex: for the year 2019, Consolidated Deforestation is composed of the combination of deforestation up to 2016;
</p><p>
<b>1.3)</b> <span>Recent deforestation</span>: includes the aggregation of the PRODES deforestation database with the 3 years prior to the date of the outbreak, added to the DETER data for the period, while there is no availability of PRODES deforestation for the current year. Example: For the year 2024, Recent Deforestation is composed of PRODES deforestation data from 2023, 2022 and 2021 plus DETER data between August 1, 2023 and the last month processed;
</p><p>
<b>1.4)</b> <span>Primary vegetation</span>: PRODES primary vegetation mask for the current PRODES year;
</p><p>
<b>1.5)</b> <span>Secondary vegetation</span>: secondary vegetation mask for the project
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.terraclass.gov.br/">TerraClass</a> for the year 2022; </p><p>
<b>1.6)</b> <span>Non-Forest Primary Vegetation</span>: (only for the Amazon biome): Non-forest vegetation
present within the Amazon biome. Example: savannah area located in the north of the state of Roraima, also known as lavrado; </p>

<b>2)</b> Regarding the crossing of active fires and rural properties in the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index">Rural Environmental Registry (CAR)</a>,
maintained by the Brazilian Forest Service:
</p>

<p>
<b>2.1)</b> <span>Fire data</span><sup>1</sup>: geographic coordinates of active fires in
vegetation extracted from the reference satellite - AQUA/MODIS
afternoon passage - obtained monthly from the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/">Queimadas-INPE Portal</a>; </p><p>
<b>2.2)</b> <span>CAR</span>: The CAR rural property database (downloaded on April 26, 2023) was cropped by the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biome boundary, corrected for topological errors, removal of duplicate geometries or attributes, removal of invalid geometries and canceled records.
<br/>
Based on this processing, CAR rural properties were classified into four types:
<br/>
Minifundio: up to 1 fiscal module. Small: between 1 and 4 fiscal modules. Medium: between 4 and 15 fiscal modules. Large: larger than 15 fiscal modules. </p>

The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect active fires in vegetation,
indicate an inaccuracy in the spatial location of geographic coordinates of approximately 1 km
