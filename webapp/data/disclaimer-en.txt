Attention: The input data was changed in October 2024, regarding:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Aggregation class. Secondary Vegetation data is no longer used;</li>
<li> Spatial scope. The new series includes all biomes in Brazil;</li>
<li> Temporal scope. The new series includes data since August/2018;</li>
</ul>
<p>
Therefore, it was necessary to reprocess the entire database of active fires from August 1, 2018 to September 31, 2024. As a result, the current data may present variations in relation to the data available before this reprocessing. </p>
</div>

<p>
The objective of this panel is to analyze the fires in vegetation,
detected by satellite, by the Queimadas project, in two aspects:
<br/>
<b>1)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires x Suppression of Primary Vegetation;
<br/>
<b>2)</b> Burns x CAR; <br>
<small>The information is updated daily and may undergo minor changes in the last two months.<br />
Each year, after the publication of the PRODES Brazil data, the data from the previous year will be reprocessed,
using PRODES data, where DETER data was used, causing variations in the classifications of the last year.</small>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>
<b>1)</b> Regarding the suppression of primary vegetation, the data generated by the PRODES and DETER projects are used,
to associate the active fires with the areas of recent suppression, consolidated suppression or areas of primary vegetation,
as described below:
</p>

<p>
<b>1.1)</b> <span>Focuses</span><sup>1</sup>: geographic coordinates of the active fires in vegetation extracted from the
reference satellite - AQUA/MODIS afternoon passage - obtained monthly in
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/">Portal Queimadas-INPE</a>;
</p><p>
<b>1.2)</b> <span>Consolidated suppression of primary vegetation</span>: includes the aggregation of the entire PRODES primary vegetation suppression database older than 3 years. A 500-meter buffer was applied to this set.
Ex: for the year 2019, the consolidated suppression is composed of the sum of suppressions up to 2016;
</p><p>
<b>1.3)</b> <span>Recent suppression of primary vegetation</span>: includes the aggregation of the PRODES primary vegetation suppression database younger than 3 years, added to the DETER data for the period, while there is no availability of the PRODES primary vegetation suppression for the current year. A 500-meter buffer was applied to this set. Example: For the year 2024, the recent suppression is composed of the PRODES suppressions of 2023, 2022 and 2021 plus DETER data between August 1, 2023 and the last month processed;
</p><p>
<b>1.4)</b> <span>Primary vegetation</span>: PRODES primary vegetation mask for the current PRODES year; </p>

<b>2)</b> Regarding the crossing of fire spots and rural properties in the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index">Rural Environmental Registry (CAR)</a>,
maintained by the Brazilian Forest Service:
</p>

<p>
<b>2.1)</b> <span>Focuses</span><sup>1</sup>: geographic coordinates of fire spots in
vegetation extracted from the reference satellite - AQUA/MODIS
afternoon passage - obtained monthly from the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/">Queimadas-INPE Portal</a>; </p><p>
<b>2.2)</b> <span>CAR</span>: The CAR rural property database (downloaded on April 26, 2023) was cropped by the limits of Brazil's biomes,
corrected for topological errors, removal of duplicate geometries or attributes, removal of invalid geometries and canceled records.
A 500-meter buffer was applied to this set. <br/>
Based on this processing, rural properties in the CAR were classified into three types:
<br/>
<ul>
<li> Small: smaller than 4 fiscal modules.</li>
<li> Medium: between 4 and 15 fiscal modules.</li>
<li> Large: larger than 15 fiscal modules.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<p>
<span>Other Class</span>: Assigned to the focus when it is not possible to associate it with the aggregation classes considered.
Example: When a focus has coordinates outside the limits of the new biomes of Brazil,

The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect active fires in vegetation,
indicate an inaccuracy in the spatial location of geographic coordinates of approximately 1 km
(<a class="general-info-links" href="https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal/faq/index.html">FAQ Queimadas (15.)</a>).

To compensate for this possible inaccuracy, for each polygon in the databases of items 1.2 and 1.3, an area of ​​influence (external buffer)
of 500 meters was considered. In other words, a focus recorded as being in recent or consolidated suppression may have been detected within
the suppression area or up to 500 meters from its surroundings.

For the CAR rural property database, an area of ​​influence (external buffer) of 500 meters was also considered,
aiming to compensate for possible inaccuracies in the location of the focuses.
