The purpose of this panel is to analyze the focuses of fire in vegetation detected
by the Queimadas project in two ways: <b> 1) </b> Queimadas x Deforestations and <b> 2) </b> Queimadas x CAR.
<br>
<small> The information will be updated monthly. </small>
</p>
<p>
<b> 1) </b> In relation to deforestation, are used the data generated by the projects PRODES and DETER, to associate the focuses of fire in vegetation with areas of recent deforestation, consolidated deforestation or primary forest areas, as described below:
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b> 1.1) </b> Focuses: geographical coordinates of vegetation heat sources extracted from the reference satellite - AQUA / MODIS afternoon pass - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas"> Portal Queimadas-INPE </a>;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 1.2) </b> Consolidated deforestation: PRODES database aggregating all deforestation
  already mapped until 2017;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 1.3) </b> Recent deforestation: PRODES database aggregating deforestation
  2018-2019 and adding DETER's deforestation data between August 1, 2019 and the last month for which the data are already complete;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 1.4) </b> Primary forest: PRODES forest mask for 2019.
  </p> <p>
  The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect the focuses of fire in vegetation,
  indicate an imprecision in the spatial location of the geographical coordinates of approximately 1 km
  (<a class="general-info-links" href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal/informacoes/perguntas-frequentes#p15"> FAQ Queimadas </a>).
  To compensate for this possible inaccuracy, for each database polygon in items 1.2 and 1.3, it is  considered an area of ​​influence (external buffer) of 500 meters.
  That is, a focus accounted for as recent or consolidated deforestation may have been detected  within the deforested area or up to 500 meters from its surroundings.

<p>
<b> 2) </b> In relation to the crossing of focuses of fire and the rural real estate of the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index"> Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) </a>,
maintained by the Brazilian Forest Service:
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b>2.1)</b> Focuses: geographical coordinates of focuses of fire in
  vegetation extracted from the reference satellite - AQUA / MODIS
  afternoon pass - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas"> Portal Queimadas-INPE </a>;
  </p><p>
  <b>2.2)</b> The CAR's rural real estate base was cut by the limit of the Amazon biome, corrected for topological errors, removal of geometry or duplicate attributes,
  removal of invalid geometries and canceled registrations.
  Based on this processing, CAR's rural real estate were classified into three types:
  small, less than 4 fiscal modules; average lasting between 4 and 15 fiscal modules;
  and large, those with more than 15 fiscal modules.
  <br/>
  For the CAR's rural real estate base, an area of ​​influence of 500 meters (external buffer) was also considered, aiming to compensate for possible inaccuracies in the location of the focuses.
