About this information:

The objective of this panel is to analyze the hot spots detected by satellite
by the Queimadas project in relation to the deforestation data generated by the
PRODES and DETER projects, aiming to associate the outbreaks with areas of
recent deforestation, consolidated deforestation or areas of primary forest.

For this, the following are considered:

1) Focuses: Geographic coordinates of fires in
 vegetation extracted from the reference satellite - AQUA / MODIS in the late
 afternoon - obtained at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas">www.inpe.br/queimadas</a>;

2) Consolidated deforestation: PRODES database aggregating all deforestation
already mapped until 2017;

3) Recent deforestation: PRODES database aggregating deforestation in 2018 and
2019 and adding DETER deforestation data between August 1, 2019 until the last
available month;

4) Forest: PRODES forest mask for the year 2019.

Note: The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect hot spots,
indicate an imprecision in the spatial location of the geographical coordinates
of approx. 1 km.

Thus, to compensate for this deviation, an external buffer of 500 meters was added
to the database of items 2 and 3. That is, a focus accounted for as recent or
consolidated deforestation, may have been detected within the deforested area
or up to 500 meters of the deforestation boundies.
