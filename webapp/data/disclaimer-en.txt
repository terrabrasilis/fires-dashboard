This panel analyzes the active fires detected by the Queimadas project with
<b> 1) </b>deforestation data from PRODES and DETER projects and<b> 2) </b>property data from the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) database.
<br>
<small> The information will be updated monthly. </small>
</p>
<p>
<b> 1) </b> PRODES and DETER deforestation data are used to associate the active fires with areas of recent deforestation, consolidated deforestation, or primary vegetation, as follows:
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b> 1.1) </b> Fire data: geographical coordinates of active fires, extracted from images of the reference satellite - AQUA / MODIS afternoon passages - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas"> Portal Queimadas-INPE </a>;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.2) </b> Recent deforestation: deforested areas mapped by PRODES in <del>2018, 2019 and 2020</del> 2019, 2020 and 2021 plus DETER deforestation alerts mapped between August 1, 2020 and the last month for which data are available;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.3) </b> Consolidated deforestation: PRODES database aggregating all deforestation already mapped until <del>2017</del> 2018;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.4) </b> Primary vegetation: PRODES primary vegetation mask for 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>1.5)</b> Secondary vegetation: <a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.terraclass.gov.br/">TerraClass</a> secondary vegetation mask for 2020 (only Amazon).
  </p>
  <p>
  The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect the active fire indicate an imprecision in the fire coordinates' spatial location at most 1 km 
  (<a class="general-info-links" href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal/informacoes/perguntas-frequentes#p15">FAQ Queimadas</a>).
  <del>To compensate for this possible inaccuracy, for each database polygon in items 1.2 and 1.3, an area of ​​influence (external buffer) of 500 meters is considered. This means that a fire accounted for as recent or consolidated deforestation may have been detected within the deforested area or up to 500 meters from its border.</del>
  </p>

<p>
<b> 2) </b> Regarding the analyses of active fires and the properties in the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index"> Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) </a>,
maintained by the Brazilian Forest Service:
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b>2.1)</b> The CAR rural property database was crossed for the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Rural property geometries have been fixed to remove any topological errors, invalid geometries, and duplicate attributes. Canceled registrations were also removed.
  After this preprocessing, CAR's properties were classified into four groups: smallholdings up to 1 fiscal module; small, between 1 and 4 fiscal modules; average between 4 and 15 fiscal modules; and large, those with more than 15 fiscal modules;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>2.2)</b> Active fire: geographical coordinates of active fires, extracted from images of the reference satellite - AQUA/MODIS afternoon passages - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas"> Portal Queimadas-INPE </a>;
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
  For CAR's database, an area of ​​influence of 500 meters (external buffer) was <del>also</del> considered, aiming to compensate for possible inaccuracies in the active fires' location.
