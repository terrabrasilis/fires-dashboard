The purpose of this dashboard is to analyze the fire focuses detected
by the Queimadas project on two aspects: <b> 1) </b> Queimadas x PRODES and <b> 2) </b> Queimadas x CAR.
<br>
<small> The information will be updated monthly. </small>
</p>
<p>
<b> 1) </b> Regarding the deforestation data generated by the PRODES and DETER projects, aiming to associate
focuses on areas of recent deforestation, consolidated deforestation or
primary forest areas.
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b> For this, the following are considered: </b>
  <br>
  <b> 1.1) </b> Focus: Geographic coordinates of vegetation fires from the satellite
  reference - AQUA / MODIS afternoon pass - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas">Portal Queimadas-INPE</a>;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 1.2) </b> Consolidated deforestation: PRODES database aggregating all deforestation
  already mapped until 2017;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 1.3) </b> Recent deforestation: PRODES database aggregating deforestation
  2018-2019 and adding the DETER demounting data between
  August 1, 2019 and last current month;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 1.4) </b> Forest: PRODES forest mask referring to the year 2019.
  </p> <p>
  <b> Obs1: </b> The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect hot spots,
  indicate an imprecision in the spatial location of the geographical coordinates of
  approx. 1 km (<a class="general-info-links" href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal/informacoes/perguntas-frequentes#p15"> FAQ Queimadas </a>).
  Thus, to compensate for this deviation, on the database of items 2 and 3, a
  500-meter external buffer. In other words, a focus counted as being on recent deforestation
  or consolidated, it may have been detected within the deforested area or up to 500 meters from its surroundings.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
<b> 2) </b> Regarding the properties included in the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR / SFB), aiming to associate
the focus on the size of rural properties stratified in Large, Medium and Small.
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b> For this, the following are considered: </b>
  <br>
  <b> 2.1) </b> Focus: Geographic coordinates of vegetation fires extracted from the satellite
  reference - AQUA / MODIS afternoon pass - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas">Portal Queimadas-INPE</a>;
  </p> <p>
  <b> 2.2) </b> Three layers of the CAR, separated into: Small (less than 4 fiscal modules), Medium (between 4 and 15 fiscal modules) and
  Large (greater than 15 fiscal modules). Considering a "clean" version of the CAR properties, clipped by the limit of the Amazon biome,
  eliminated from topological errors, with removal of duplicate geometries / attributes,
  invalid geometry and canceled records.
  </p> <p>
  <b> Obs2: </b> For these three layers, an external buffer of 500 meters was also observed, aiming at
  compensate for the inaccuracy of the focus (Obs1).
