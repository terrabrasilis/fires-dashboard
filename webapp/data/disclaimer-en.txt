<b>Attention:</b> The reference data was changed on November 1, 2023, in relation to the aggregation periods.
The classification until October 2023 was not reprocessed and uses previous periods, as informed at the end of this text.

The objective of this panel is to provide a way to analyze active fires detected by the Queimadas project from two aspects:
<b> 1) </b>Active fires x Deforestations and <b> 2) </b>Active fires x CAR.
<br>
<small> The information will be updated monthly. </small>
</p>
<p>
<b> 1) </b> PRODES and DETER deforestation data are used to associate the active fires with areas of recent deforestation, consolidated deforestation or primary vegetation, and the TerraClass data are used to associate the active fires with areas of secondary vegetation, as follows:
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b> 1.1) </b> <span>Fire data</span>: geographical coordinates of active fires, extracted from images of the reference satellite - AQUA / MODIS afternoon passages - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas"> Portal Queimadas-INPE </a>;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.2) </b> <span>Consolidated deforestation</span><sup>1</sup>: PRODES database aggregating all deforestation already mapped until 2019, used for classifications from November 2023 onwards;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.3) </b> <span>Recent deforestation</span><sup>2</sup>: deforested areas mapped by PRODES in 2020, 2021 and 2022 plus DETER deforestation alerts mapped between August 1, 2022 and the last month for which data are available;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.4) </b> <span>Primary vegetation</span>: PRODES primary vegetation mask for 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b> 1.5)</b> <span>Secondary vegetation</span><sup>3</sup>: <a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.terraclass.gov.br/">TerraClass</a> secondary vegetation mask from 2022 for the Amazônia biome and 2020 for the Cerrado biome.
  </p>
  <p>
  The characteristics of the reference satellite used to detect the active fire indicate an imprecision in the fire coordinates' spatial location at most 1 km 
  (<a class="general-info-links" href="https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal/faq/index.html">FAQ Queimadas (15.)</a>).
  </p>

<p>
<b> 2) </b> Regarding the analyses of active fires and the properties in the
<a class="general-info-links" href="https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index"> Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) </a>,
maintained by the Brazilian Forest Service:
</p>

<div class = "paragraph">
  <p>
  <b>2.1)</b> Active fire: geographical coordinates of active fires, extracted from images of the reference satellite - AQUA/MODIS afternoon passages - obtained at <a class="general-info-links" href="http://www.inpe.br/queimadas"> Portal Queimadas-INPE </a>;
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>2.2)</b> The CAR rural property database was crossed for the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Rural property geometries have been fixed to remove any topological errors, invalid geometries, and duplicate attributes. Canceled registrations were also removed.
  After this preprocessing, CAR's properties were classified into four groups: smallholdings up to 1 fiscal module; small, between 1 and 4 fiscal modules; average, between 4 and 15 fiscal modules; and large, those with more than 15 fiscal modules;
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  <p>
  For CAR's database, an area of ​​influence of 500 meters (external buffer) was considered, aiming to compensate for possible inaccuracies in the active fires' location.

    <sup>1</sup> <small>The aggregation considered data until 2018 as <span>Consolidated deforestation</span> used for classification between August/2022 and October/2023.<br></small>
